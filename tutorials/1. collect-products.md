# Collect Products
In this tutorial, we will go over a list of clients and their receipts, collecting per client and in total how many items we are going to need. The list of orders is provided by multiple people in different formats.

In the `data/receipts` directory, you will find the receipts from different people in CSV and JSON formats. A client can have bought the same product multiple times, so we have to count the quantity of the products.
## Start Hints:
- There is a package called encoding/json that can be used to decode JSON data.
- There is also a package called encoding/csv that can be used to decode CSV data.
- You can read files with the os package.
- You can collect files with the os package.
- You can join folders with the path package.
## Walkthrough
### 0. Setup
We should already have a main.go and a cmd/root.go that has been created by cobra-cli. If not, please go back to the start tutorial.
First, we need to create a new subcommand called collect-products in the cmd/root.go file. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
cobra-cli add collect-products
```

This command will create a new subcommand in the cmd folder with a collect-products.go file in it.
Next, open the `cmd/collect-products.go` file and replace its content with the following code:
```go
package cmd

import (
    "fmt"

    "github.com/spf13/cobra"
)

var collectProductsCmd = &cobra.Command{
    Use:   "collect-products",
    Short: "Collect the products from the receipts",
    Run: collectProducts,
}

func collectProducts(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {
    fmt.Println("collectProducts called")
}
```

### 1. Receipt Format
If we look at the data in `data/receipts`, we can see that the data is in different formats.
**CSV**
```csv
id,quantity,note,price,tax,time
2049cb74-a413-4e0e-ba88-08edf86ad809,2,41fed8d04548,11.901973411244565,1.723017722749384,2024-06-04T09:46:27+02:00
```

**JSON**
```json
{
    "items": [
        {
            "id": "2049cb74-a413-4e0e-ba88-08edf86ad809",
            "quantity": 2,
            "note": "41fed8d04548",
            "price": 11.901973411244565,
            "tax": 1.723017722749384,
            "time": "2024-06-04T09:46:27+02:00"
        }
    ]
}
```

From this data, we can see that the data is about the same. So let's create a struct that can hold the data from the receipts.

Open your `cmd/collect-products.go` file and add the following code at the top, just after the import statements:
```go
type Product struct {
    ID       string    `json:"id"`
    Quantity int       `json:"quantity"`
    Note     string    `json:"note"`
    Price    float64   `json:"price"`
    Tax      float64   `json:"tax"`
    Time     time.Time `json:"time"`
}

type Receipt struct {
    Items []Product `json:"items"`
}
```
The text after the types (e.g., `json:"id"`) is a field tag. This is used to tell the encoder/decoder where to find the data in the data. For example, json:"id" means that the ID field in the struct is stored in the id field in the JSON. The CSV package doesn't use field tags but uses the order of the fields in the struct.

### 2. Reading the Data

Let's create separate functions that can read the data from the different formats.

Add/Update the following code to your cmd/collect-products.go file:

**CSV**
```go
// Updated list of imports:
import (
    "encoding/csv"
    "errors"
    "fmt"
    "io"
    "os"
    "strconv"
    "time"
)

// FromCSV reads a CSV file and returns a Receipt
func FromCSV(filepath string) (*Receipt, error) {
    // Open the file for reading
    file, err := os.Open(filepath)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    // Close the file when we're done
    defer file.Close()

    // Create a new CSV reader
    r := csv.NewReader(file)
    receipt := &Receipt{}

    for {
        record, err := r.Read()
        // The reader will return an error if it's at the end of the file
        if errors.Is(err, io.EOF) {
            return receipt, nil
        }
        if err != nil {
            // This is a custom error message, with the original error as a cause
            // This is useful for debugging, as it will show the original error
            return nil, fmt.Errorf("failed to read record: %s: %w", record, err)
        }
        // Check if the record has enough items for us to read
        if len(record) < 6 {
            return nil, fmt.Errorf("not enough items in: %v", record)
        }
        // Check if the record is the header:
        if record[0] == "id" {
            continue
        }

        item := Product{
            ID:   record[0],
            Note: record[2],
        }

        // These convert the strings to the correct types and into their fields
        if item.Quantity, err = strconv.Atoi(record[1]); err != nil {
            return nil, fmt.Errorf("failed to parse quantity: %s: %w", record[1], err)
        }
        if item.Price, err = strconv.ParseFloat(record[3], 64); err != nil {
            return nil, fmt.Errorf("failed to parse price: %s: %w", record[3], err)
        }
        if item.Tax, err = strconv.ParseFloat(record[4], 64); err != nil {
            return nil, fmt.Errorf("failed to parse tax: %s: %w", record[4], err)
        }
        if item.Time, err = time.Parse(time.RFC3339, record[5]); err != nil {
            return nil, fmt.Errorf("failed to parse time: %s: %w", record[5], err)
        }

        // Add the item to the receipt
        receipt.Items = append(receipt.Items, item)
    }
}
```

Add the following code to your cmd/collect-products.go file:

**JSON**
```go
// Updated list of imports:
import (
    "encoding/json"
    "os"
)

// FromJSON reads a JSON file and returns a Receipt
func FromJSON(filepath string) (*Receipt, error) {
    file, err := os.Open(filepath)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    defer file.Close()

    receipt := &Receipt{}
    // Decode needs a pointer to the struct, so it can fill it with the data
    if err := json.NewDecoder(file).Decode(receipt); err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }

    return receipt, nil
}
```

Now we can create a function that can read the data from the different formats.

Add the following code to your `cmd/collect-products.go` file:

```go
func ReadReceipt(filepath string) (*Receipt, error) {
    switch ext := filepath.Ext(filepath); ext {
    case ".csv":
        return FromCSV(filepath)
    case ".json":
        return FromJSON(filepath)
    default:
        return nil, fmt.Errorf("unknown file extension: %s", ext)
    }
}
```

### 3. Collecting the data

Now that we can read the data, we can start collecting the data. 
We create a function that walks over the client directories in `data/receipts` and reads their receipts.

Add the following code to your cmd/collect-products.go file:

```go
import (
    "os"
    "path/filepath"
)

// CollectReceipts collects all receipts in the specified folder, it assumes that the folder contains only receipts
func CollectReceipts(folder string) ([]*Receipt, error) {
    receipts := []*Receipt{}

    // Walk walks the on all files and directories in the folder
    err := filepath.Walk(folder, func(filepath string, info os.FileInfo, err error) error {
        if err != nil {
            return err
        }
        if info.IsDir() {
            return nil
        }

        receipt, err := ReadReceipt(filepath)
        if err != nil {
            return fmt.Errorf("failed to read receipt: %s: %w", filepath, err)
        }
        receipts = append(receipts, receipt)

        // Return nil, because we don't have an error
        return nil
    })

    return receipts, err
}
```

Next, we create a function that collects all receipts for each client.

Add the following code to your `cmd/collect-products.go` file:

```go
// Client represents a client with their receipts
type Client struct {
    ID     string
    Receipts []*Receipt
}

// CollectProducts collects products for all clients
func CollectProducts() ([]*Client, error) {
    dir := filepath.Join("data", "receipts")
    clients := []*Client{}

    // Each dir is a client, with in those dirs all their receipts
    err := filepath.Walk(dir, func(clientFolder string, info os.FileInfo, err error) error {
        if err != nil {
            return err
        }
        if !info.IsDir() {
            return nil
        }

        client := &Client{
            ID: info.Name(),
        }
        clients = append(clients, client)

        receipts, err := CollectReceipts(clientFolder)
        if err != nil {
            return fmt.Errorf("failed to collect receipts: %s: %w", filepath, err)
        }
        client.Receipts = receipts

        return nil
    })

    return clients, err
}
```

### 4. Counting the items

A client can have bought the same product multiple times, so we have to count the quantity of the products. 
We are going to create an object that stores the final result.

Add the following code to your `cmd/collect-products.go` file:

```go
// Overview represents the total quantity of products to buy
type Overview struct {
    ToBuy map[string]int
}

// Add adds the products from a receipt to the overview
func (o *Overview) Add(receipt *Receipt) {
    for _, product := range receipt.Items {
        o.ToBuy[product.ID] += product.Quantity
    }
}

// AddClient adds the products from a client's receipts to the overview
func (o *Overview) AddClient(client *Client) {
    for _, receipt := range client.Receipts {
        o.Add(receipt)
    }
}

// Print prints the overview with a title
func (o *Overview) Print(title string) {
    fmt.Println("====", title, "====")
    for id, quantity := range o.ToBuy {
        fmt.Printf("%s: %d\n", id, quantity)
    }
}
```

Now we convert the collected clients in a total per client and in total.

Update collectProducts with the following code to your `cmd/collect-products.go` file:

```go
func collectProducts(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {
    total := &Overview{
        ToBuy: map[string]int{},
    }
    clientData := map[string]*Overview{}
    clients, err := CollectProducts()
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error collecting products:", err)
        return
    }

    for _, client := range clients {
        clientOverview := &Overview{
            ToBuy: map[string]int{},
        }
        clientData[client.ID] = clientOverview

        total.AddClient(client)
        clientOverview.AddClient(client)
    }

    total.Print("Total")
    for id, client := range clientData {
        client.Print("client " + id)
    }
}
```

### 5. Run the command

Now we can run the command and see the results. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
go run main.go collect-products
```
