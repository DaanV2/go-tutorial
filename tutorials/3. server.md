# Golang Server

We are going to use the `http` package to create a simple server that serves a static file. And provides some api handling

## Setup

First, add a new subcommand with cobra-cli, using the terminal or command prompt. Enter the following command:

```bash
cobra-cli add server
```

This command will create a new subcommand called chromecast in your project. It will update your go.mod file and create a new file called chromecast.go in the cmd folder.

## Walkthrough

### 1. Create a server

In the `cmd/server.go` file, we are going to create a new server that serves a static file.

1. Open the `cmd/server.go` file in your code editor.
2. Update the code in the file:

```go
package cmd

import (
    "net/http"

    "github.com/spf13/cobra"
)

// serverCmd represents the server command
var serverCmd = &cobra.Command{
    Use:   "server",
    Short: "Start a server",
    Run: serverWorkload,
}

func init() {
	rootCmd.AddCommand(serverCmd)
}

func serverWorkload(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {
    // This function will contain the server code
}
```

3. Explanation:
    - **Package Declaration**: The file starts with package cmd, indicating that this file is part of the cmd package.
    - **Imports**: The necessary packages are imported. In this case, `github.com/spf13/cobra` is imported to use Cobra's functionalities.
    - **Command Variable**: chromeCastCmd is a variable of type *cobra.Command. This variable represents the chromecast subcommand.
    - **Command Definition**: The &cobra.Command{} struct is used to define the command. It includes:
      - **Use**: The name of the command.
      - **Short**: A brief description of the command.
      - **Long**: A longer description that can include examples and usage.
      - **Run**: A function that contains the code to execute when the command is run. Which inputs are the command itself and any arguments passed to it that the user specifies.
    - **Initialization**: The init() function is a magic golang function used to add the chromecast command to the root command (rootCmd). This makes the chromecast command available in your CLI application.

### 2. Basic server

We are going to create a basic server that serves a static file.

1. In the serverWorkload function, add the following code:

```go
func serverWorkload(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {
    // Create a new ServeMux (router)
    router := http.NewServeMux()
    
    // Handle the root URL ("/") and serve files from the "static" directory
    router.Handle("/", http.FileServer(http.Dir("./static")))

    // Create a new server on port 8080
    server := http.Server{
        Addr: ":8080",
        Handler: router,
    }

    // Print a message when the server starts
    fmt.Println("Server started at ", server.Addr)
    
    // Print a message when the server closes
    defer fmt.Println("Server closed")
    
    // Start the server and listen for connections
    err := server.ListenAndServe()
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println(err)
    }
}
```

### 3. Test the server

Now we can test the server by running and then opening the browser at `http://localhost:8080`. By using the following terminal command:

```bash
go run main.go server
```

Go to your browser and open `http://localhost:8080`. You should see the static file served by the server.

### 4. Waiting for a shutdown signal

With `ctrl+c` we can close the server. But this is not a graceful shutdown.
We can wait for a shutdown signal to close the server gracefully. But first, we need to move the serve listener to a goroutine. 
This will allow us to listen for signals while the server is running.

Move the server listener to a goroutine by updating the following code inside the serverWorkload function:

```go
go func() {
    fmt.Println("Server started at ", address)
    defer fmt.Println("Server closed")

    if err := server.ListenAndServe(); err != nil {
        if !errors.Is(err, http.ErrServerClosed) {
            fmt.Println("Server error: ", err)
        }
    }
}()
```

Then below that, we can wait for a signal to close the server:

```go
func serverWorkload(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {
    // Existing code here...

    // Await for signal to close server
    signals := make(chan os.Signal, 1)
    // Signal: INTerupt, TERMinate, QUIT
    signal.Notify(signals, syscall.SIGINT, syscall.SIGTERM, syscall.SIGQUIT)

    // This will block until a signal is received
    <-signals
    fmt.Println("Server is shutting down")

    // Graceful shutdown
    err := server.Shutdown(context.Background())
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error while shutting down server: ", err)
    }
    if err := server.Close(); err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error while closing server: ", err)
    }
}
```

We use .Shutdown() to gracefully shutdown the server. Which will close anything that is not sending requests. Normally, clients or browsers will keep the connection open for a while. And may send requests over that connection.

We gracefully shutdown getting rid of any connections that are not sending requests. This will also block all new requests/connections.

After that we do a hard close with .Close() to close the server.
In production you would probably want to do a hard close after a certain amount of time or wait for a second signal. But for this example, we are just going to do it right away.

### 5. Test the server

Now we can test the server by running and then opening the browser at `http://localhost:8080`.

```bash
go run main.go server
```

Then hit `ctrl+c` in the terminal.

### 6. Add an api endpoint

We are going to add an api endpoint that returns a timestamp. This will work with the button in the static file.

In the serverWorkload function, add the following code to handle the `/api/timestamp` endpoint:
This should be placed before the `router.Handle("/", http.FileServer(http.Dir("./static")))` line.

```go
// Handle the "/api/timestamp" endpoint
// The input parameters are the response writer and the request object which contains information about the request that the user made.
router.HandleFunc("/api/timestamp", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    // Set the HTTP status code to 200 OK
    w.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)
    
    // Get the current time and format it as an RFC3339 string -> "2006-01-02T15:04:05Z07:00"
    d := time.Now().Format(time.RFC3339)
    
    // Write the formatted time string to the response body
    _, err := w.Write([]byte(d))
    
    // Check if there was an error while writing the response
    if err != nil {
        // Print the error message to the console
        fmt.Println("Error while writing response: ", err)
    }
})
```

Dont forget to test it!

### 7. Logging Middleware

Middleware is a way to wrap around the request and response. This allows you to do things like logging, authentication, etc. It sits between the server object and the route handlers.

Create a new struct called `Logger` and add a `ServeHTTP` method:

```go
type Logger struct {
    // Next is the what the middleware will call after it is done
    Next http.Handler
}

func (l *Logger) ServeHTTP(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    // This will print a specific message to the console, whereby each %s is a placeholder for a string value
    fmt.Printf("[%s] %s %s\n", time.Now().Format(time.DateTime), r.Method, r.URL.Path)
    l.Next.ServeHTTP(w, r)
}
```

Patch the server object with the middleware by updating the server variable:

```go
server := http.Server{
    Addr: ":8080",
    Handler: &Logger{Next: router},
}
```

This concludes the tutorial. You have successfully created a Golang server that serves a static file, handles an API endpoint, and includes logging middleware.
