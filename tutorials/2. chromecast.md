# Chromecast
We are going to use the go-chromecast library to interact with the Chromecast. This tutorial will guide you step-by-step on how to set up and use the library.

## Setup

First, we need to add a new subcommand using the cobra-cli tool. Open your terminal and run the following command:
```bash
cobra-cli add chromecast
```
This command will create a new subcommand called chromecast in your project. It will update your go.mod file and create a new file called chromecast.go in the cmd folder.

## Installation

To install the go-chromecast library, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
go get github.com/vishen/go-chromecast
```

This command will download and install the library so you can use it in your project. It will also update your go.mod file with the library dependency.

## Cobra Command Structure

When you run the command cobra-cli add chromecast, it generates a new subcommand for your application. This subcommand will have its own file and structure. Here's a breakdown of what is generated and what each part does:

1. File Structure:
   - cmd/chromecast.go: This file contains the code for the chromecast subcommand.
2. Generated Code:
   - The chromecast.go file will have the following structure:

```go
package cmd

import (
    "github.com/spf13/cobra"
)

// chromeCastCmd represents the chromecast command
var chromeCastCmd = &cobra.Command{
    Use:   "chromecast",
    Short: "A brief description of your command",
    Long: `A longer description that spans multiple lines and likely contains
examples and usage of using your command. For example:

Cobra is a CLI library for Go that empowers applications.
This application is a tool to generate the needed files
to quickly create a Cobra application.`,
    Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {
        // Code to execute when the command is run
    },
}

func init() {
    rootCmd.AddCommand(chromeCastCmd)

    // Here you will define your flags and configuration settings.
    // Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command
    // and all subcommands, e.g.:
    // chromeCastCmd.PersistentFlags().String("foo", "", "A help for foo")

    // Cobra also supports local flags, which will only run
    // when this action is called directly, e.g.:
    // chromeCastCmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle", "t", false, "Help message for toggle")
}
```

3. Explanation:
    - **Package Declaration**: The file starts with package cmd, indicating that this file is part of the cmd package.
    - **Imports**: The necessary packages are imported. In this case, `github.com/spf13/cobra` is imported to use Cobra's functionalities.
    - **Command Variable**: chromeCastCmd is a variable of type *cobra.Command. This variable represents the chromecast subcommand.
    - **Command Definition**: The &cobra.Command{} struct is used to define the command. It includes:
      - **Use**: The name of the command.
      - **Short**: A brief description of the command.
      - **Long**: A longer description that can include examples and usage.
      - **Run**: A function that contains the code to execute when the command is run. Which inputs are the command itself and any arguments passed to it that the user specifies.
    - **Initialization**: The init() function is used to add the chromecast command to the root command (rootCmd). This makes the chromecast command available in your CLI application.
    - **Flags**: Flags can be defined within the init() function. Flags are options that users can pass to the command to modify its behavior.

## Walkthrough

### 1. Discover Chromecasts

First, we need to add a flag to the command so we can specify the device name we want to connect to.

Open the file `cmd/chromecast.go`.
Find the `func init()` function.
Add the following line to the end of the `func init()` function:

```go
chromeCastCmd.Flags().StringP("name", "n", "", "Name of the device")
```

This line adds a flag called name that we can use to specify the Chromecast device name.  
Next, we need to add code to get the value of the name flag.
In the same file (`cmd/chromecast.go`), find the `Run` function.  
Add the following line at the beginning of the `Run` function:

```go
name, err := cmd.Flags.GetString("name")
if err != nil {
    fmt.Println(err)
    return
}
```

This line retrieves the value of the name flag.
Now, we will add a function to discover the Chromecasts on the network. This function will return a list of available devices.

Update the imports at the top of the file to include the following:

```go
import (
    "context"
    "time"
    "fmt"
    "net"
    "strings"

    "github.com/vishen/go-chromecast/application"
    "github.com/vishen/go-chromecast/dns"
)
```

Add the following function to the file (can be placed anywhere in the file):

```go
func listDevices() ([]dns.CastEntry, error) {
    // Create a context with a timeout of 15 seconds.
    ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), time.Second*time.Duration(5))
    defer cancel()

    // The discovery process takes a few seconds to receive all the devices.
    // It pumps the results into a channel.
    // When it's done, it closes the channel.
    castEntryChan, err := dns.DiscoverCastDNSEntries(ctx, nil)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    devices := []dns.CastEntry{}
    // Pump the results into a slice. This will exit when the channel is closed.
    for d := range castEntryChan {
        devices = append(devices, d)
    }

    return devices, nil
}
```

This function will discover the Chromecasts on the network and return a list of devices.

`Note`: If the function returns nothing, it might be a Windows-specific issue that needs a specific interface to listen on. You can add the following code to specify the interface:
Add this line inside the listDevices function, before the dns.DiscoverCastDNSEntries call:

```go
iface, err := net.InterfaceByName("WiFi")
if err != nil {
    return nil, err
}
```

Update the dns.DiscoverCastDNSEntries call to include the interface:

```go
castEntryChan, err := dns.DiscoverCastDNSEntries(ctx, iface)
```

### 2. Display the Devices

Now we can display the devices to the user. We are going to do this when the user does not specify a device name.

In the `Run` function, replace the existing code with the following:

```go
    Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {
        name, err := cmd.Flags.GetString("name")
        if err != nil {
            fmt.Println(err)
            return
        }

        devices, err := listDevices()
        if err != nil {
            fmt.Println(err)
            return
        }
        if name == "" {
            fmt.Println("Devices:")
            for _, device := range devices {
                fmt.Println(device.DeviceName, device.GetAddr(), device.GetPort(), device.GetUUID(), device.Device)
            }
            return
        }
    },
```

This code will display the list of available devices if no device name is specified.

### 3. Show a GIF

Now we can show a GIF on the Chromecast.
In the `Run` function, replace the existing code with the following:

```go
    Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {
        // Retrieve the value of the "name" flag. This is the name of the Chromecast device we want to connect to.
        name, err := cmd.Flags.GetString("name")
        if err != nil {
            fmt.Println(err)
            return
        }

        // Call the listDevices function to discover available Chromecast devices on the network.
        devices, err := listDevices()
        if err != nil {
            // If there's an error discovering devices, print the error and exit the function.
            fmt.Println(err)
            return
        }

        // If no device name is specified (name is an empty string), list all discovered devices.
        if name == "" {
            fmt.Println("Devices:")
            // Loop through the list of discovered devices and print their details.
            for _, device := range devices {
                fmt.Println(device.DeviceName, device.GetAddr(), device.GetPort(), device.GetUUID(), device.Device)
            }
            return
        }

        // Variable to hold the device that matches the specified name.
        var device *dns.CastEntry
        // Loop through the list of discovered devices to find the one that matches the specified name.
        for _, d := range devices {
            // Perform a case-insensitive comparison of the device names.
            if strings.EqualFold(d.DeviceName, name) {
                // If a match is found, assign the device to the variable and break the loop.
                device = &d
                break
            }
        }

        // If no matching device is found, print a message and exit the function.
        if device == nil {
            fmt.Println("Device not found")
            return
        }

        // Print a message indicating that we are connecting to the specified device.
        fmt.Println("Connecting to device", device.DeviceName)
        // Create a new application instance to interact with the Chromecast.
        app := application.NewApplication()
        // Start the application and connect to the specified device using its address and port.
        if err = app.Start(device.GetAddr(), device.GetPort()); err != nil {
            // If there's an error starting the application, print the error and exit the function.
            fmt.Println("Error starting application: ", err)
            return
        }

        // Load a GIF onto the Chromecast. The URL of the GIF is specified as the first parameter.
        err = app.Load(
            "https://media1.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExYWx1bGxyY2piZmVzeTVkcDR0c2JrZW1td2c5ZjlmaGswcmF4bWhsZCZlcD12MV9naWZzX3NlYXJjaCZjdD1n/lOa0tPKiMLdqVdFiS8/giphy.webp",
            0,    // The second parameter is the start time in seconds (0 means start from the beginning).
            "",   // The third parameter is the content type (empty string means auto-detect).
            false, // The fourth parameter is whether to autoplay (false means do not autoplay).
            false, // The fifth parameter is whether to loop (false means do not loop).
            false, // The sixth parameter is whether to mute (false means do not mute).
        )
        if err != nil {
            // If there's an error loading the media, print the error and exit the function.
            fmt.Println("Error loading media: ", err)
            return
        }
    },
```

This code will connect to the specified Chromecast device and display a GIF.
