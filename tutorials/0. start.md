# Setup

Setup the go project, in vscode hit `ctrl+J` to open the terminal and run the following commands.
Or if you know how to use the terminal, open the terminal and run the following commands.

This will create a go module, which is a way to manage dependencies in go, as well as tell go where the project is located.
```sh
go mod init github.com/<username>/<project>

OR

go mod init foo.com/<username>/<project>
```

Next up we will install a package called `cobra-cli` which is a command line interface package that will help us create a command line interface tools for our project.
```sh
go install github.com/spf13/cobra-cli@latest
```

Next up we will create a command line interface tool using `cobra-cli` package.

```sh
cobra-cli init
```

Note it will have created a `cmd` folder with a `root.go` file in it. as well as a `main.go` file in the root of the project.

To test your code run the following command. Which will print the help message for your command line interface tool.

```sh
go run main.go
```
